## Development

To see Go errors in VSCode, use the extension https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.Go

To run locally, run `go run .` from the top level of the repo and go to localhost:8080

After making Go changes, run `go run .` again to see changes. After making html/css changes, you will have to clear your browser cache, then reload the page
