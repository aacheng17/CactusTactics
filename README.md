## Development

To see Go errors in VSCode, use the extension https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.Go

To run locally, run `go run .` from the top level of the repo and go to localhost:8080

After making Go changes, run `go run .` again to see changes
After making html/js/css changes, you may have to clear your browser cache. Then reload the page
